# linuxdeploy Build Helper Container

A docker container that aims to help build an
[AppImage](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit) on multiple architectures
using [linuxdeploy](https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy).

Latest version: v3-jammy

## Available architectures

    amd64
    arm64

## Usage

Make a `docker` sub-directory within your project and copy `.env` and
`docker-compose.yml` to it. Add custom variables to suit your needs.

To build the AppImage:

    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm build

This is meant to be run from the source root of your project. Using the
command above, your current directory will be mounted in the container at
`/workspace`.

You can see an example of an AppImage build script at
[rmw/packaging/appimage/pre-appimage.sh](https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut/rmw/blob/master/packaging/appimage/pre-appimage.sh).
Add the `/path/to/script` in your custom `.env` file.

When the container starts, 'root' changes the UID of user 'builder' (a user
created during the build of the Dockerfile) to match the host user's. This
allows builder to build your project and create the AppImage without root
privileges (the resulting files will be owned by you).

The host UID/GID are auto-detected from the owner of the bind-mounted
workspace (Docker preserves host ownership across bind mounts), so the
typical invocation above needs no extra environment.

You can still pass `HOSTUID` and `HOSTGID` explicitly to override the
auto-detection — useful when the workspace ownership doesn't match the
invoking user, or in some CI matrices — by exporting them before running
`docker-compose`:

    export HOSTUID=$(id -u) HOSTGID=$(id -g)

You may use `sudo` in your script to install packages or do other things.

If you would like to look around the container, you can use

    docker run -it --rm --entrypoint bash andy5995/linuxdeploy:v3-jammy

> [!NOTE]
> The image is also available from the GitHub Container Registry:
>
> ```
> docker pull ghcr.io/andy5995/linuxdeploy-build-helper-container:v3-jammy
> ```

## Locally

To build for other architectures, you may need to use qemu with docker. There
may be other ways, but you can check out [this
document](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/docker/building-arm-container-on-x86)
for starters. If you are set up to build on other architectures, edit the
**PLATFORM** variable in docker-compose.yml, or export it when running
`docker-compose`:

    PLATFORM=linux/arm64 docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml pull build

To pull the image for the corresponding architecture. Then run
`docker-compose` by preceding it again with the PLATFORM variable:

    PLATFORM=linux/arm64 docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm build

Alternatively, you can export the variable:

    export PLATFORM=linux/arm64

And then run the `docker-compose` commands without preceding them with the
variable.

## In a GitHub Runner

See [test.yml](https://github.com/andy5995/linuxdeploy-build-helper-container/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/test.yml)

## linuxdeploy Plugins

These plugins are installed in the container:

* [linuxdeploy-plugin-gtk](https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy-plugin-gtk)
* [linuxdeploy-plugin-qt](https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy-plugin-qt)

## Note

The container runs Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish). See [this
discussion](https://github.com/orgs/AppImage/discussions/1254) for more
details on why I chose that version of Ubuntu.

Some 'GITHUB_...' variables will not work inside the container.

Recent versions of cmake, meson, and ninja are installed to
'/home/builder/.local/bin' which is the first path in PATH (installing them
with `apt` will probably offer no benefit).

If you want to see more details about the container or what packages are
pre-installed, look at the two Dockerfiles in this repository. If you'd like
more packages pre-installed, please open an issue.

## Contributing

Ok, but it's a good idea to open an issue and ask about a change before
starting work on a pull request. Someone, or myself, may already be working on
it, or planning to. Also, please consult [this
guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests)
before you submit a pull request.
